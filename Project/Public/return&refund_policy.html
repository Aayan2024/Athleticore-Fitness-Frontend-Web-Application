        <h1>Return & Refund Policy</h1>

        <p>We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If for any reason you are not, please review our return & refund policy below. By purchasing from us, you agree to the terms of this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Return Eligibility</h2>
        <p>To be eligible for a return, the item must be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unused and in the same condition that you received it.</li>
            <li>In the original packaging with all tags, labels, and accessories intact.</li>
            <li>Returned within 30 days of the purchase date (unless otherwise stated for specific items).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the product does not meet these criteria, we reserve the right to deny the return request.</p>

        <h2>2. Non-Returnable Items</h2>
        <p>Certain items are non-returnable, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Opened or used products.</li>
            <li>Perishable goods (e.g., food items, vitamins, etc.).</li>
            <li>Gift cards, downloadable software, or digital products.</li>
            <li>Personalized or custom-made products.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How to Return an Item</h2>
        <p>If you are eligible for a return, please follow these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact our customer support team at <strong>support@example.com</strong> or call us at <strong>(123) 456-7890</strong> to initiate the return process.</li>
            <li>Provide your order number, the item(s) you wish to return, and the reason for the return.</li>
            <li>We will send you instructions on how to return the item, including the return address.</li>
            <li>Pack the item securely in its original packaging, including all accessories and paperwork.</li>
            <li>Ship the item back using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance (we do not guarantee that we will receive the returned item if it is not trackable).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Refund Process</h2>
        <p>Once we receive your returned item, we will inspect it to ensure it meets the return criteria. If everything is in order, we will process your refund to the original method of payment.</p>
        <p>The time it takes for the refund to appear on your account may vary depending on your payment provider, but it typically takes 7-10 business days.</p>

        <h2>5. Exchanges</h2>
        <p>If you would like to exchange a product for a different size or color, please follow the same process as for a return. Once we receive the returned product, we will ship the replacement product to you. The replacement item will be shipped based on product availability.</p>

        <h2>6. Shipping Costs</h2>
        <p>Shipping costs for returns and exchanges are the responsibility of the customer unless the return is due to a mistake made by us (e.g., incorrect or defective item). We recommend using a trackable shipping service for returns to ensure your package is received.</p>

        <p>If you receive a defective or damaged item, please contact us immediately at <strong>support@example.com</strong> or call us at <strong>(123) 456-7890</strong> with your order number and a description of the issue. We will arrange for a replacement or refund at no additional cost to you.</p>

        <h2>8. Late or Missing Refunds</h2>
        <p>If you haven’t received your refund after 10 business days, please check your bank account and contact your credit card company or bank, as there may be processing delays. If you’ve done all of this and still have not received your refund, please contact us at <strong>support@example.com</strong>.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Our Return & Refund Policy</h2>
