        <h1>Warranty Policy</h1>

        <p>Welcome to our warranty policy page. We want to ensure you are fully satisfied with your purchase. Please read our warranty policy to understand the terms under which our products or services are covered.</p>

        <h2>1. Warranty Coverage</h2>
        <p>Our products come with a limited warranty that covers defects in material or workmanship under normal use. The warranty covers the repair or replacement of the product if it is found to be defective.</p>

        <h2>2. Warranty Period</h2>
        <p>The warranty period begins from the date of purchase and lasts for a specified period. The period will vary depending on the product and can range from 1 year to 5 years. The exact warranty duration will be indicated on the product page or invoice.</p>

        <h2>3. What is Covered</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Manufacturing defects</li>
            <li>Faulty parts and materials</li>
            <li>Problems that arise under normal usage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. What is Not Covered</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Damage due to misuse, accidents, or neglect</li>
            <li>Damage caused by unauthorized repair or modification</li>
            <li>Wear and tear from regular usage (e.g., scratches, fading, etc.)</li>
            <li>Damage due to exposure to environmental factors (e.g., water, extreme heat, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. How to Make a Warranty Claim</h2>
        <p>If you believe your product is defective and falls within the warranty period, please contact our customer support team with the following details:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your order number or proof of purchase</li>
            <li>A description of the defect or issue</li>
            <li>Photos of the product (if applicable)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once we receive your warranty claim, we will assess the issue and provide you with the next steps. If your claim is approved, we will either repair or replace the product, or issue a refund, depending on the nature of the defect and the warranty terms.</p>

        <h2>6. Repair or Replacement</h2>
        <p>If the product is covered under warranty, we will repair or replace the defective product at no cost to you. If a replacement is not available, we may offer a similar product of equal value or issue a full refund.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitations</h2>
        <p>Our warranty does not cover incidental or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, loss of data, or inconvenience caused by a faulty product. The warranty is void if the product has been damaged due to misuse or improper handling.</p>

        <h2>8. Returns and Exchanges</h2>
        <p>If your product is eligible for return or exchange under our warranty, please follow our returns procedure. We may require the product to be returned to us before a replacement or repair can be processed.</p>

        <h2>9. International Warranty</h2>
        <p>If you purchased our product outside of our primary sales region, the warranty may vary based on location. Please check with our customer support team to confirm your warranty terms if you are located outside of the specified region.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to Warranty Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update or modify this warranty policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the updated policy will take effect immediately after it is posted. We encourage you to review the warranty policy periodically.</p>
